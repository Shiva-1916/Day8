        <h4>Ram charan- Orange 2010</h4>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong>Ram, a graffiti artist in Australia, angrily defaces a mural of his latest ex-girlfriend. Police officer Abhishek Verma arrives on the scene to make inquires. "Love is my problem," Ram replies, and narrates his story. Ram believes, no matter how much two people love each other, the love will eventually fade. He has fallen in and out of love nine times. His tenth love is Jaanu, a bubbly eternal-romantic. He relentlessly pursues her; but when he refuses to declare eternal love for her, their clashing ideologies keep them apart. But how did Ram form his opinions of love?</p>
