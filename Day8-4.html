        <strong>Story Line: </strong>To carry out the biggest heist in history,
        a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers
        who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose.
        Five months of seclusion memorizing every step, every detail, every
        probability culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage
        and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens
        of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will
        lead to everything or nothing
